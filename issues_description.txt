1) File upload warning and error messages using an HTML5 control in wkwebkit and an external webpage

2) Keyboard error messages when accessing a webpage text input

Three File upload messages:

1) When the user taps the upload icon, an iPhone menu appears allowing a selection of either Photo Library, Take Photo, Choose File. When the Take photo option is selected the following notice appears in the XCode panel:

[Camera] Attempted to change to mode Portrait with an unsupported device (BackWideDual). Auto device for both positions unsupported, returning Auto device for same position anyway (BackAuto)

2) Once the photo has been taken the phone displays the "use photo " button. Once the "use photo" button is clicked I see the message:
[Sandbox] Could not enable Mach bootstrap, errno = 1

3) When the submit button is clicked I see the following message:
[assertion] Error acquiring assertion: <Error Domain=RBSServiceErrorDomain Code=1 "originator doesn't have entitlement com.apple.runningboard.assertions.webkit

I have looked at the pInfo privacy related settings and could not find an appropriate one for this message, nor could I find relevant details in Apple's API.

Note the submit will n to save the photo. The submit button is just for demonstartion to trigger the 3rd warning message in this example app.

2) When the user enters the textarea by tapping in the textarea I see the a series of constraint messages. I believe these are related to the Apple's keyboard on a webpage and not the app interface.
